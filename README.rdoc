# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is a the sample application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

In this tutorial I'll be learning how to implement static pages with rails. This is in chapter 3 of the [Rails 3.2 book](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages).
